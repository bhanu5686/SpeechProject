				Steps to Execute Application


Steps to run for developers : 
	1.Select Defualt User radio button
	2.Train if not trained
	3.Testing if required
	4.use calculate buttton to use as calculator



Steps to run for end users : 
	1.Select End User radio button
	2.Train if not trained

	steps to train:
		a.click on button Training
		b.browse directory where end user recording (digits 0-9 with starting index as 0 upto 9 with each utterances 30 times and words (plus,minus,multiply,divide) with starting index as 10 upto 13 with each utterances 30 times all stored in a single folder.

	3.Testing if end user wants to check accuracy
	4.use calculate buttton to use as calculator



Steps to run for calculator for both types of users: 

	1.click on calculate button  for recording first digit (if user is not satified with recorded digit, he/she can record again after clicking on calculate button again).

	2.if user is satified with recorded digit, then he/she must have to check first checbox to ensure for recording of next word (plus,minus,multiply,divide). 

	3.Then click on calculate button  for recording  (if user is not satified with recorded operation, he/she can record again after clicking on calculate button again).

	4.if user is satified with recorded word, then he/she must have to check second checbox to ensure for recording of second digit. 

	5.Then click on calculate button  for recording third digit, (if user is not satified with recorded digit, he/she can record again after clicking on calculate button again).

 	6. .if user is satified with recorded digit, then he/she must have to check third checbox to get the output result.

	7.If user wants to performed another calculation the he/she have to use clear button and then starts from step 1-6 again.


Note :  If Application crashes then configure a project to target a 64-bit platform as follows:

1.On the menu bar of visual studio 2010, choose Build > Configuration Manager.

2.In the Active solution platform list, choose a 64-bit platform for the solution to target, and then choose the Close button.

3.If the platform that you want doesn't appear in the Active solution platform list, choose New.

4.The New Solution Platform dialog box appears.

5.In the Type or select the new platform list, choose x64.


	a.If you give your configuration a new name, you may have to modify the settings in the Project Designer to target the correct platform.

6.If you want to copy the settings from a current platform configuration, choose it, and then choose the OK button.
